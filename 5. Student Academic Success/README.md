# Student Academic Success

Level: 1.3

tags: EDA, Classification

Project-over-Project improvements:
* First time applying machine learning. Used `sci-kit learn`'s `RandomForestClassifier`.
* Divided EDA as needed. Did some EDA before preprocessing to get a closer look on problems needed fix during preprocessing. While the EDA after focused on finding patterns in the features to help in choosing the model. Richer EDA as I used different types of charts (Heatmaps, barplots, & countplots), mixing between seaborn and matplotlib
* Added initial cleaning stage. Where I did some simple pre-processing to clean up the data before diving into it.
* Detected and solved multi-collinearity in the data. 

Problem definition:

> Higher education institutions face a critical challenge with student dropout rates and academic failure, which not only impacts individual students' futures but also represents significant resource loss for educational institutions. Early identification of at-risk students can enable timely interventions and support strategies that improve retention and academic success rates.
> 
> The objective is to develop a machine learning classification model that can predict student academic outcomes using information available at enrollment and early academic performance indicators.
