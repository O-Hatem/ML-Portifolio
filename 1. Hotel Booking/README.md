Level: 1.1

tags: data-preprocessing, feature-engineering

Problem Definition:
> My aim is to practice data preprocessing by transforming this raw hotel booking dataset into a high-quality, ML-ready dataset by systematically detecting and addressing data quality issues—such as missing values, duplicates, outliers, and irrelevant features—while preserving valid booking records. This will set a solid foundation for accurate and trustworthy analytical or predictive tasks downstream.

* Preprocessing Steps:
  * Handling missinga data
  * Removing duplicates
  * Correcting data types
  * Handling imbalaned data
  * Categorical encoding
  * Handling Outliers
  * Feature Engineering
