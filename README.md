# ðŸ§  Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio
A curated collection of hands-on projects showcasing my skills in data science, machine learning, and analytics.

<!--- Purpose of this repo --->
## Purpos of this repo
Honestly, this is made for me before anyone else. This is my way to document my progress. Which as I use as evidence to convience myselfy I'm actually moving forward & not standing still.

And, of course, as a portfolio for recrutiers to see how I use my skills and build practical end-to-end data science projects.
