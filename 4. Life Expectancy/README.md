# Life Expectancy 

Level: 1.2

tags: EDA

Project-over-Project improvements:
* First time to use multiple files within the same project.
* Instead of recreating the articles within the article. I attempted to create me own to explore the sections of the data I want to see.
* The EDA is more in depth. Although, all the charts are simple line graphs. However, the preparation needed for each chart is more complex that before.
* The charts is better looking and easier on the eye than the default Matplotlib style.

problem definition:

> One of the key indicators of a population’s overall health and development is **life expectancy** — a measure that reflects not only access to healthcare, but also the quality of education, nutrition, public safety, and infrastructure.
> 
> We aim to use the **"Global Life Expectancy"** dataset from *Our World in Data* to conduct a focused analysis on **life expectancy trends across African countries**. The dataset includes life expectancy figures across different years, age groups, and genders, enabling a multidimensional understanding of longevity in the region.
> 
> By identifying patterns and anomalies in life expectancy data, we hope to answer questions such as:
> * Which African countries have experienced the most or least improvement in life expectancy over time?
> * Are there significant disparities in life expectancy between genders or age groups?
> * What external factors might correlate with lower life expectancy in certain regions?
> 
>The ultimate goal of this analysis is to **prioritize intervention**. The insights will help us identify **which countries or demographics require urgent attention**, and guide our efforts toward **evidence-based policies and programs** aimed at improving youth outcomes, reducing mortality, and promoting long-term development.
